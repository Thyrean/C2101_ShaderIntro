# C210104_IntroductionToShaderProgramming

Final Version for Shader Programming Submission!

You can find my Submission in: Assets/Shaders/Submission

I created a smoke bomb with reference from Valorant (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UIkrVE-rcK_uRVnq-VgGD4ABochvui2p/view?usp=sharing).

I did not follow any tutorial, just used the methods we applied during the course (lots of UV Scrolling, Noises, Fresnel, Vertex Displacement, etc.).
I took inspiration from water shaders I saw and used their edge detection/intersection detection in my shader to create an effect when the Smoke Bomb touches objects.


Additionally (as coding practice), I recreated the Nebula Weapon Shader from Valorant as Shader Code - no shader graph!
I used shader graph to get a idea on how do it in code and then implemented it as Vertex/Fragment Shader code.
